# ESP32 Binary Classification Implementation Summary

## Overview
Updated ESP32 SmartBin system to use binary recyclable/non-recyclable classification while maintaining support for detailed 9-class classification from the GUI.

## Motor Configuration Updates

### Angle Constants (Updated)
```cpp
const int SLIDING_HOME = 90;           // Home position (center)
const int SLIDING_RECYCLABLE = 30;     // Recyclable bin position (reduced angle)
const int SLIDING_NON_RECYCLABLE = 150; // Non-recyclable bin position (reduced angle)
const int COIN_HOME = 90;              // Coin dispenser home position (updated)
const int COIN_DISPENSE = 0;           // Coin dispense position (updated)
```

### Previous vs Current Angles
| Motor | Previous Home | Previous Action | Current Home | Current Action |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Sliding | 90° | 0°/180° | 90° | 30°/150° |
| Coin | 0° | 100° | 90° | 0° |

## Classification Logic

### 9-Class to Binary Mapping
**Recyclable Materials:**
- aluminium
- carton  
- glass
- paper_and_cardboard
- plastic

**Non-Recyclable Materials:**
- ewaste
- organic_waste
- textile
- wood

### Motor Control Sequence

#### Recyclable Items:
1. Dispense coin: Move to 0° → Return to 90°
2. Route waste: Move to 30° → Hold 3s → Return to 90°

#### Non-Recyclable Items:
1. Route waste: Move to 150° → Hold 3s → Return to 90°
2. No coin dispensed

## Bluetooth Command Interface

### Available Commands:
- `recyclable` - Manually process recyclable waste (with coin)
- `non-recyclable` - Manually process non-recyclable waste (no coin)
- `test-servos` - Test both servo motors
- `status` - Display system status and configuration

### Command Usage:
```
// Connect via Bluetooth to "SmartBin_ESP32"
// Send commands (case-insensitive):
recyclable
non-recyclable
test-servos
status
```

## System Features

### Automatic Operation:
- Ultrasonic sensor detects items
- ESP32-CAM captures image
- Laptop performs 9-class YOLO classification
- ESP32 maps result to binary action
- Motors execute sorting with appropriate coin dispensing

### Manual Control:
- Bluetooth commands for testing and manual operation
- Status monitoring via Bluetooth
- Servo testing functionality

## Key Improvements

1. **Reduced Motor Range**: Angles changed from 0°-180° to 30°-150° for sliding motor
2. **Binary Classification**: Simplified from 4-class to 2-class system
3. **Coin Dispenser Logic**: Only activates for recyclable materials
4. **Command Interface**: Added Bluetooth control for testing and manual operation
5. **Status Monitoring**: Real-time system status via Bluetooth

## Integration Notes

- ESP32 continues to receive detailed classification from laptop (9 classes)
- Internal mapping converts detailed classification to binary motor actions
- GUI can still display specific waste types while ESP32 handles binary sorting
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing classification pipeline

## Files Modified

- `SmartBinEsp.ino` - Main ESP32 control logic
  - Updated motor angle constants
  - Implemented binary classification mapping
  - Added Bluetooth command interface
  - Updated test servo angles

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test servo movement with new angles using `test-servos` command
2. Verify coin dispensing only occurs for recyclable items
3. Test Bluetooth commands for manual operation
4. Validate automatic classification with sample waste items
5. Monitor system status during operation
